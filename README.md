# python_autosync
a python app that uses uploader premium to sync files in a folder to a remote source

basically it uses the uploader-premium's inbuilt API to not just upload files but to sync them accross the remote and local sources.

please note that:
- it requires an uploader-premium API key to use.
- its not perfect there are alot of opportunities to break the whole system
- requires that you've set up uploader premium somewhere
