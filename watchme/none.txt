new items are awesome
old items are valuable
	and expensive
	and rare
	and bought by old people
	and filthy rich ones too
	and most people cant buy them
	and i still dont know if i would buy them if i could
	anyway ill wait to get rich first, then we'll see
cheap items are good
	except when you want them to last long
	or you want something reliable

anyway i bought a new phone on monday this week. i wanted a permanent solution but turns out that comes with quite a price tag ðŸ˜…
